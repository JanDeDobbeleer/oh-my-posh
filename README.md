This repo was made with love using GitKraken.

[![GitKraken shield][kraken]][kraken-ref]

What started as the offspring of [oh-my-posh2][oh-my-posh2] for PowerShell resulted in a cross platform,
highly customizable and extensible prompt theme engine. After 4 years of working on oh-my-posh,
a modern and more efficient tool was needed to suit my personal needs.
