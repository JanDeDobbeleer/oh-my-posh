# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest [release][releases] is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be send in via [email][email] to avoid publishing in the open.
Oh My Posh does not have a bountry program, neither do we respond to beg bounties.

For valid security concerns, you can expect a response within 48 hours,
and credit is given once an acceptable fix is found and published.
