## Create the logic

Add a new file following this convention: `new_segment.go`.
Ensure `new` is a single verb indicating the context the segment renders.

You can use the following template as a guide.

```go
package main

type new struct {
    props          *properties
    env            environmentInfo
}

const (
    //NewProp switches something
    NewProp Property = "newprop"
)

func (n *new) enabled() bool {
    return true
}

func (n *new) string() string {
    newText := n.props.getString(NewProp, "\uEFF1")
    return newText
}

func (n *new) init(props *properties, env environmentInfo) {
    n.props = props
    n.env = env
}
```

When it comes to properties, make sure to use the UTF32 representation (e.g. "\uEFF1") rather than the icon itself.
This will facilitate the review process as not all environments display the icons based on the font being used.
You can find these values and query for icons easily at [Nerd Fonts][nf-icons].

For each segment, there's a single test file ensuring the functionality going forward. The convention
is `new_segment_test.go`, have a look at existing segment tests for inspiration.

## Create a name for your Segment

[`segment.go`][segment-go] contains the list of available `SegmentType`'s, which gives them a name we can map from the
`.json` [themes][themes].

Add your segment.

```go
//New is brand new
New SegmentType = "new"
```

## Add the SegmentType mapping

Map your `SegmentType` to your Segment in the `mapSegmentWithWriter` function.

```go
New: &new{},
```

## Test your functionality

Even with unit tests, it's a good idea to build and validate the changes:

```shell
go build -o $GOPATH/bin/oh-my-posh
```

## Add the documentation

Create a new `markdown` file underneath the [`docs/docs`][docs] folder called `segment-new.md`.
Use the following template as a guide.

````markdown
---
id: new
title: New
sidebar_label: New
---

## What

Display something new.

## Sample Configuration

```json
{
  "type": "new",
  "style": "powerline",
  "powerline_symbol": "\uE0B0",
  "foreground": "#193549",
  "background": "#ffeb3b",
  "properties": {
    "newprop": "\uEFF1"
  }
}
```

## Properties

- newprop: `string` - the new text to show - defaults to `\uEFF1`
````

## Map the new documentation in the sidebar

Open [`sidebars.js`][sidebars] and add your document id (`new`) to the items of the Segments category.

## Add the JSON schema

Edit the `themes/schema.json` file to add your segment.

At `$.definitions.segment.properties.type.enum`, add your `SegmentType` to the array:

```json
new,
```

At `$.definitions.segment.allOf`, add your segment details:

```json
{
  "if": {
    "properties": {
      "type": { "const": "new" }
    }
  },
  "then": {
    "title": "Display something new",
    "description": "https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/new",
    "properties": {
      "properties": {
        "properties": {
          "nwprop": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "New Prop",
            "description": "the new text to show",
            "default": "\uEFF1"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
