## Install dependencies

### go

The codebase is in [go][go], meaning we need a working go setup before we can do anything else.
Have a look at the [go guide][go-started] to get up and running with go in no time!

:::caution
Oh My Posh needs at least go 1.17.
:::

### golangci-lint

To make sure we keep on writing quality code, [golang-ci lint][golang-ci-lint] is used to validate the changes.
Have a look at the [local installation guide][golang-ci-lint-local] to make sure you can validate this yourself as well.

## Get the source code

The source is hosted on [Github][omp]. When you want to contribute, create a [fork][gh-fork] so you can make changes in
your repository and create a pull request in the official Oh My Posh repository.

Clone your fork of Oh My Posh locally, replace `<user>` with your Github username.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<user>/oh-my-posh.git
```

## Running tests

The go source code can be found in the `src/` directory, make sure to change to that one before continuing.

### Unit tests

```bash
go test -v
```

### golangci-lint

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

## Building the app

The easiest way to validate your changes is to write tests. Unfortunately, as it's a visual tool, you'll want to validate
the changes by running the prompt in your shell as well. You can make use of go's `bin` folder which is usually added to
your path to add your own Oh My Posh binary to and immediately see the changes appear in your shell.

```bash
go build -o $GOPATH/bin/oh-my-posh
```

## Get an editor

A default config(.vscode folder) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is available in the repo:

- golangci-lint is configured as the default linter.
- Recommended extensions available for a smooth bootstrap.

  ![recommended extensions](/img/recommended_extensions.png "Recommended extensions" )
- Default run and debug configurations available.

Once the extensions are installed:

- Debug can be started by hitting F5.
- All tests can be run using the Test explorer.

### Extra tips

#### Configure Delve in VS Code

[Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) config is restrictive by default(string limit especially). You can expand some limits in VS Code(`settings.json` or directly in `launch.json`):
```
"go.delveConfig": {

  "dlvLoadConfig": {
    "followPointers": true,
    "maxVariableRecurse": 3,
    "maxStringLen": 400,
    "maxArrayValues": 400,
    "maxStructFields": -1
  },
  "apiVersion": 2,
  "showGlobalVariables": false
}
```
