At this point, you're good to go. The `jandedobbeleer.omp.json` theme displays the most common use-cases
in your prompt, so 9/10 you'll be more than happy with it. However, if you want to explore additional
functionality, going through the additional steps below will help you get started.

#### Change the theme

We downloaded all the themes and set `jandedobbeleer.omp.json` as the one to use.
However, there are [a lot more][themes] to be discovered and maybe there are some you like better.

#### Override the theme settings

Maybe there's a theme you like, but you don't fancy the colors. Or, maybe there's a segment you
want to tweak/add, or replace some of the icons with a different one. Whatever the case, read through all
available options first, by starting with the [configuration guide][configuration].

You can output the current theme to the format you like (`json`, `yaml` or `toml`) which can be used to tweak
and store as your custom theme.
