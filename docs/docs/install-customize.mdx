:::tip
When using oh-my-posh in Windows and the WSL, know that you can share your theme with the WSL by pointing to a theme in your
Windows user's home folder.

Inside the WSL, you can find your Windows user's home folder here: `/mnt/c/Users/<WINDOWSUSERNAME>`.

### Change the theme

We downloaded all the themes and set `jandedobbeleer.omp.json` as the one to use.
However, there are [a lot more][themes] to be discovered and maybe there are some you like better.

### Override the theme settings

Maybe there's a theme you like, but you don't fancy the colors. Or, maybe there's a segment you
want to tweak/add, or replace some of the icons with a different one. Whatever the case, read through all
available options first, by starting with the [configuration guide][configuration].

You can output the current theme to the format you like (`json`, `yaml` or `toml`) which can be used to tweak
and store as your custom theme.
