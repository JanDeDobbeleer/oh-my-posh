A [Homebrew][brew] formula is available for easy installation.

```bash
brew tap jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh
brew install oh-my-posh
```

This installs two things:

- `oh-my-posh` - Executable, added to `/usr/local/bin`
- `themes` - The latest Oh My Posh [themes][themes]

If you want to use a standard theme, you can find them in `$(brew --prefix oh-my-posh)/themes`, referencing them as such
will always keep them compatible when updating Oh My Posh.

## Update

```bash
brew upgrade oh-my-posh
```

## Replace your existing prompt

The guides below assume you copied the theme called `jandedobbeleer.omp.json` to your user's `$HOME` folder.
When using brew, you can find this one at `$(brew --prefix oh-my-posh)/themes/jandedobbeleer.omp.json`.
