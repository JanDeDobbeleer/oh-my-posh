### Setup your terminal

As the standard terminal has issues displaying the ANSI characters correctly, we advise using
[iTerm2][iterm2] or any other modern day MacOS terminal that supports ANSI characters.

### Installation

A [Homebrew][brew] formula is available for easy installation.

```bash
brew tap jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh
brew install oh-my-posh
```

This installs two things:

- `oh-my-posh` - Executable, added to `/usr/local/bin`
- `themes` - The latest Oh My Posh themes

If you want to use a standard theme, you can find them in `$(brew --prefix oh-my-posh)/themes`, referencing them as such
will always keep them compatible with the binary when updating Oh My Posh.

#### Preview the themes

```bash
for file in $(brew --prefix oh-my-posh)/themes/*.omp.json; do echo "$file\n"; oh-my-posh --config $file --shell universal; echo "\n"; done;
```

#### Update

```bash
brew upgrade oh-my-posh
```

### Replace your existing prompt

The guides below assume you copied the theme called `jandedobbeleer.omp.json` to your user's `$HOME` folder.
When using brew, you can find this one at `$(brew --prefix oh-my-posh)/themes/jandedobbeleer.omp.json`.
