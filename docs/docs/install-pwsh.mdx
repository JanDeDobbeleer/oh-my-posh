:::info
This guide is for usage inside PowerShell only. If you plan to use Oh My Posh inside other shells as well,
have a look at the platform-specific install instructions.
:::

## Installation

```powershell
Install-Module oh-my-posh -Scope CurrentUser
```

:::caution
If you wish to install for **all users in a linux** environment, you will need to install from an **elevated PowerShell session**.
You will also need to import the module one time from the elevated session in order to set the executable permissions correctly.

```powershell
sudo pwsh
Install-Module oh-my-posh -Scope AllUsers
Import-Module oh-my-posh
```
:::

After installation, import Oh My Posh in your `$PROFILE`. Restart your shell and Oh My Posh will start downloading
a compatible version of the executable (this is kept in sync on update).

```powershell
Import-Module oh-my-posh
```

## List all themes

To display every available theme in the current directory, use the following
cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-PoshThemes
```

The module installs all themes in the module folder. To find the actual files, you can use the following command:

```powershell
Get-PoshThemes -list
```

## Replace your existing prompt

Edit `$PROFILE` in your preferred PowerShell version and add the following line. Autocompletion is available so it will loop
through all available themes.

```powershell
Set-PoshPrompt -Theme jandedobbeleer
```

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```powershell
. $PROFILE
```

<Customize />

```powershell
Export-PoshTheme -FilePath ~/.mytheme.omp.json -Format json
```

Once you're done editing, adjust your `$PROFILE` to use your newly created theme.

```powershell
Set-PoshPrompt -Theme ~/.mytheme.omp.json
```

## Update

```powershell
Update-Module oh-my-posh
```
