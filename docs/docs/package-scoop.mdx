A [Scoop][scoop] package that installs the Oh my Posh Windows and Linux binaries on Windows.
Use these in your shell of choice afterwards by going through the [installation guide][install].

:::caution Font icons
For maximum enjoyment, make sure to **install** and **configure** your terminal to use a powerline enabled font.
The fonts we use are patched by [Nerd Fonts][nerdfonts], which offer a maximum of icons you can use to configure your prompt.
To easily find the icon you want, have a look at their [cheat sheet][nf-cheat].

## Installation

```powershell
scoop install https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh3/releases/latest/download/oh-my-posh.json
```

This installs a couple of things:

-  `posh-windows-amd64.exe` - Windows executable, added to your `$PATH`
-  `posh-linux-amd64` - Linux executable, added to your `$PATH` for use in the WSL
-  `themes` - The latest Oh m my Posh themes

If you want to use a standard theme, you can find them in `~\scoop\apps\oh-my-posh\current\themes\`, referencing them as such
will always keep them compatible with the binary when updating Oh my Posh.

## Update

```powershell
scoop update oh-my-posh
```
