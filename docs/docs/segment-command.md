## What

:::caution Powershell
While powerful, it tends to take a lot of time executing the command on **Powershell**.
Even with `â€“noprofile` it's noticeably slower compared to `sh`. It's advised to look at using
[environment variables][env] when using Powershell.
:::

Command allows you run an arbitrary shell command. Be aware it spawn a new process to fetch the result, meaning
it will not be able to fetch session based context (look at abusing [environment variables][env] for that).
When the command errors or returns an empty string, this segment isn't rendered.

You have the ability to use `||` or `&&` to stitch commands together and achieve complex results. When using `||`
the first command that returns a string will be used (or none when they all fail to produce output that's not an
error). The `&&` functionality will join the output of the commands when successful.

## Sample Configuration

```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "alignment": "right",
  "segments": [
    {
      "type": "command",
      "style": "plain",
      "foreground": "#ffffff",
      "properties": {
        "shell": "bash",
        "command": "git log --pretty=format:%cr -1 || date +%H:%m:%S"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Properties

- shell: `string` - the shell in which to run the command in. Uses `shell -c command` under the hood.
- command: `string` - the command(s) to run
