Oh My Posh comes with many themes included out-of-the-box. Below are some screenshots of the more common themes.
For the full updated list of themes, [view the themes][themes] in Github.  If you are using PowerShell, you can
display every available theme using the following PowerShell cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-PoshThemes
```

Once you're ready to swap to a theme, follow the steps described in [🚀Installation/Replace your existing prompt][replace-you-existing-prompt].

Themes with `minimal` in their names do not require a Nerd Font. Read about [🆎Fonts][fonts] for more information.
