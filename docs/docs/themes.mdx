Oh My Posh comes with many themes included out-of-the-box. Below are some screenshots of the more common themes.
For the full updated list of themes, [view the themes][themes] in GitHub.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="powershell"
  values={[
    { label: 'powershell', value: 'powershell', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="powershell">

You can make use of the `Export-PoshImage` function to export your current theme configuration.

```powershell
Export-PoshImage -CursorPadding 50
```

There are a couple of parameters you can use to tweak the image rendering:

- `CursorPadding`: spaces to add after the cursor indication (`_`)
- `RPromptOffset`: spaces to add **before** a block that's right aligned
- `Author`: the name of the creator, added after `https://ohmyposh.dev`
- `BGColor`: the hex background color to use (e.g. `#222222`)

If you are using PowerShell, you can display every available theme using the following PowerShell cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-PoshThemes
```

Or specify the theme you'd like to use:

```powershell
Set-PoshPrompt -Theme jandedobbeleer
```
</TabItem>

Once you're ready to swap to a theme, follow the steps described in [ðŸš€Installation/Replace your existing prompt][replace-you-existing-prompt].

Themes with `minimal` in their names do not require a Nerd Font. Read about [ðŸ†ŽFonts][fonts] for more information.
