Just like V2, oh-my-posh is available in the [PowerShell gallery][psgallery].

## V2's problem statement

Oh My Posh is the offspring of [Oh My Posh 2][omp], a prompt theme engine for PowerShell.
It started out by being inspired by tools like [Oh my ZSH][omz] when nothing was
available specifically for PowerShell.

Over the years, I switched operating system/main shell quite a lot, even on
Windows via the [WSL][wsl]. This made it so that my prompt wasn't portable enough,
I wanted the same visual/functional experience regardless
of the shell I was working in.

Additionally, V2 has Powershell module files as [themes][themesv2]. That way of working was inspired by [oh-my-zsh][omz]
and other prompt rendering tools, but that approach has a few important downsides.

- hard to extend/adjust when you're not proficient
- the need to expose a lot of functions/settings to allow ease of personalization
- limited to Powershell

## A brave new world

This brings us to the first change, to allow a cross-platform experience, [Oh My Posh][v3] is written entirely in [Go][golang].
That way, cross-platform binaries can be shipped which render the same prompt using the same config anywhere.

The configuration is changed from `$ThemeSettings` towards a `.json` file that only contains the configuration for the
blocks and segments you want to render. See [concept][introduction] for more context on that part.

Let's have a look at the V2 commands and how to move towards V3.

## Import

Stays the same! Alright. All you need to do is update oh-my-posh.

```powershell
Update-Module -Name oh-my-posh -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Configuration

Here we have a few options. If you're using an out-of-the-box theme, you can simply change the current command to the
new one, provided your V2 theme has already been added to [oh-my-posh][themesv3].

### I use an out-of-the-box theme

Change the current prompt setting function to the new one.

```powershell
# Set-Theme Agnoster
Set-PoshPrompt -Theme agnoster
```

### I use a custom theme/settings

The first thing to do is to look for the theme you based your theme on.
If you don't remember which one, preview them all and take the one closest to yours.

```powershell
Get-PoshThemes
```

If you see one you like, set it, then export its config so you can customize/extend the blocks and segments.

```powershell
Set-PoshPrompt -Theme jandedobbeleer
Export-PoshTheme -FilePath ~/.oh-my-posh.omp.json
```

Adjust the config (`~/.oh-my-posh.omp.json`) to your liking by going through the [configuration][configuration] guide.
Set your custom theme and enjoy.

```powershell
Set-PoshPrompt -Theme  ~/.oh-my-posh.omp.json
```

### I have no idea just yet

Great! There's an option for that too. You can easily list all available themes and pick the one you like best.

```powershell
Get-PoshThemes
```

Choose and set the one you like.

```powershell
Set-PoshPrompt -Theme jandedobbeleer
```

## All set, now what

You can either tweak the theme to your liking, add segments or [submit an issue][issues] for new functionality.
Do not hesitate to [ask for assistance][issues] when you notice an issue or unexpected behavior.
