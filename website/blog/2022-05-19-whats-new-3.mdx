So long, old friend!

<!--truncate-->
## PowerShell module

In the beginning, all we had was the [PowerShell Module][module]. It's the _origin of Oh My Posh_
and has remained available ever since, even with the move to Go. With that evolution however,
its advantages have been greatly reduced. In fact, it even introduced [additional hurdles][hurdles] along
the way.

As of March, the module no longer offers new functionality and displays a warning message. Have a look
at the [migration page][migration] for a guide on how to migrate from the module to other means of
installation. It only takes a minute.

## Giveaway

A fews weeks ago I started a [giveaway][giveaway] to celebrate the 6 year anniversary of Oh My Posh.
But then I went on holiday, and didn't follow up to announce the winner. So without further ado,
**congratulations to [@samerde][samerde]** for getting picked by a random online random picker and
winning the giveaway!

## Features

It's been a while, so you might want to hang tight üòÖ

### PowerShell UTF-8

In the early days, Oh My Posh was forcibly setting PowerShell to UTF-8 due to issues with fonts and paths.
However, it turned out that wasn't really necessary. A new way of invocation was introduced, which removes
the need to set this shell wide and **avoids unwanted side effects**. This can however still break path when
for example your `--config` path contains a non-ascii character. Can't win them all I guess. In that case,
set the shell to UTF-8 in the scope of initializing Oh My Posh.

```powershell
$previousOutputEncoding = [Console]::OutputEncoding
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8
try {
    oh-my-posh init pwsh --config ~/custom.omp.json | Invoke-Expression
} finally {
    [Console]::OutputEncoding = $previousOutputEncoding
}
```

### Nu shell

If you haven't seen [Nu shell][nu] yet, it's a new kid on the block. Oh My Posh now supports it just
like we support any other popular shell (bash, zsh, fish, etc). This means we can keep adding functionality
without the need for user interaction apart from updating Oh My Posh.

### Accordion

Ever wanted to have a `powerline` segment to display collapsed when disabled? Now you can!
Use the `accordion` style to display a segment in a collapsible state.

### Project

Things just keep growing. The [project][project] segment now supports the following project definitions:

- [cargo][cargo]
- [poetry][poetry]
- [php][php]
- [nuspec][nuspec]

### Shell

If you work with multiple shell versions, this one's for you. You can now use the `.Version` property
in the [shell][shell] segment to distinct between versions:

```json
"template": " in {{ .Name }} {{ .Version }} "
```

### Git

The [git][git] segment learned a new trick to make your life easier (or faster). Before we hardcoded the
untracked files mode to `normal`. However, on larger repo's this can get rather cumbersome, so we now allow
you to **override this per repo**.

```json
"untracked_modes": {
  "/Users/user/Projects/oh-my-posh/": "no"
}
```

The available options are listed in the [git documentation][git-status], use them as you see fit!

### Cross segment template properties

Wait, what? Yes, you read that right. Oh My Posh now supports **cross segment template properties**.
This means you can use one segment's properties in another segment's template. How? Oh My Posh
exposes the `.Segments` property which contains all segment's properties in a map. To make use
of another segment's data, use `{{ .Segments.Segment }}` in your template where `.Segment`
is the name of the segment you want to use with the first letter uppercased.

If you want to for example use the [git][git] segment's `.UpstreamGone` property in the [exit][exit] segment, you can
do so like this:

```json
"template": " {{ if .Segments.Git.UpstreamGone }}\uf7d3{{ else if gt .Code 0 }}\uf00d{{ else }}\uf00c{{ end }} "
```

:::caution
For this to work, the segment you refer to needs to be in your config. The above example won't work if
your config does not contain a git segment as Oh My Posh only populates the properties when it needs to.
:::

### Other

- `oh-my-posh debug` now measures the run time correctly and can log startup logic
- The language segments can now distinct between files and folders
- The [python][python] segment now supports pyenv `.python-version` files
- The `init` command has a new switch called `--strict` which no longer resolves the executable
- The [battery][battery] segment can now display all relevant states on macOS
- The [dotnet][dotnet] segment now supports `.slnf` files
- A [new][iterm] segment to display iTerm shell integration prompt marks
- The [memory][memory] segment can now display available memory
- The [path][path] segment now has a `.Writable` property, indicating if the current user
can write to the current folder

### Fixes

- The [git][git] segment can now handle repo's with `--separate-git-dir`
- Hyperlinks are correctly measured (which should display the right aligned prompt correctly)
- Prompt escape sequences are correctly escaped, this avoids unwanted visual side effects
- Spotify now works correctly on Windows for non-English systems
- Parallel logic to make things fast no longer randomly crashes on Windows
- Upstream gone logic for git was broken, and has been fixed
- PSReadLine in PowerShell now receives the correct amount of prompt lines (`Set-PSReadlineOption -ExtraPromptLineCount`),
this fixes weird behaviour when using a transient prompt when your config results in a multiline prompt
- The [winget][winget] installer now adds `PATH` entries correctly, regardless of the installation mode

That's it for this time, see you for the next one ü§ûüèª

Keep that prompt posh everyone!
