Let's take a closer look at what defines a block.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="json"
  groupId="sample"
  values={[
    { label: 'json', value: 'json', },
    { label: 'yaml', value: 'yaml', },
    { label: 'toml', value: 'toml', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="json">

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/schema.json",
  ...
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "prompt",
      "alignment": "left",
      "segments": [
        ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml">

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/schema.json
...
blocks:
  - type: prompt
    alignment: left
    segments: [
      ...
    ]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="toml">

```toml
"$schema" = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/schema.json"

[[blocks]]
type = "prompt"
alignment = "left"
segments = [
  ...
]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- type: `prompt` | `rprompt`
- newline: `boolean`
- alignment: `left` | `right`
- filler: `string`
- segments: `array` of one or more `segments`

### Type

Tells the engine what to do with the block. There are two options:

- `prompt` renders one or more segments
- `rprompt` renders one or more segments aligned to the right of the cursor. Only one `rprompt` block is permitted.
Supported on zsh, bash, PowerShell, cmd and fish.
- `newline` renders your cursor in a new line, useful if your custom prompt is full of segments and you aim at readabilty. 

:::info
Example given shows a segment with just this property as the last segment in the `blocks` list:

```json
        {
            "type": "newline"
        }
```
:::

:::tip
Do not confuse this `"type": "newline"` argument with the property `"newline": true`. The former is to append a new line (after a segment or prompt), the later is to prepend a new line (before a segment or prompt)
:::

### Newline

Start the block on a new line - defaults to `false`.

:::info
See TIP in [Type](#type 'feeling lazy, uh?') section above.
:::

### Alignment

Tell the engine if the block should be left or right-aligned.

### Filler

When you want to join a right and left aligned block with a repeated set of characters, add the character(s)
to be repeated to this property. Add this property to the _right_ aligned block. This supports the use of
[color overrides][color-overrides].

```json
"alignment": "right",
"filler": "."
```

### Segments

Array of one or more segments.
