The standard initialization sets Oh My Posh' [default theme][default-theme]. This configuration is downloaded
and kept up-to-date with Oh My Posh' version every time the shell starts. To change/alter the configuration, you need to
add the `--config` command-line option to change the configuration to use a specific file.

### Get inspiration

The best place to get started is by looking at the [themes][themes], as these are **predefined configurations** to use/alter.
To change to for example the [jandedobbeleer][jandedobbeleer] theme, alter the Oh My Posh `init` line to the following (assuming you
downloaded the configuration file to your user's home folder):

<Tabs
  defaultValue="powershell"
  groupId="shell"
  values={[
    { label: 'powershell', value: 'powershell', },
    { label: 'cmd', value: 'cmd', },
    { label: 'zsh', value: 'zsh', },
    { label: 'bash', value: 'bash', },
    { label: 'fish', value: 'fish', },
    { label: 'nu', value: 'nu', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="powershell">

```powershell
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config ~/.jandedobbeleer.omp.json | Invoke-Expression
```

Once altered, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```powershell
. $PROFILE
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cmd">

```lua title="oh-my-posh.lua"
load(io.popen('oh-my-posh init cmd --config ~/.jandedobbeleer.omp.json'):read("*a"))()
```

Once altered, restart cmd for the changes to take effect.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="zsh">

```bash
eval "$(oh-my-posh init zsh --config ~/.jandedobbeleer.omp.json)"
```

Once altered, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```bash
exec zsh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bash">

```bash
eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash --config ~/.jandedobbeleer.omp.json)"
```

Once altered, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```bash
exec bash
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="fish">

```bash
oh-my-posh init fish --config ~/.jandedobbeleer.omp.json | source
```

Once altered, reload your config for the changes to take effect.

```bash
. ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nu">

:::warning
Oh My Posh requires Nushell >= 0.60.0
:::

Edit `$nu.configuration/path` and add the following lines at the bottom.

```bash
oh-my-posh init nu --config ~/.jandedobbeleer.omp.json
source ~/.oh-my-posh.nu
```

If you want to save the initialization script elsewhere, replace the lines above with these:

```bash
oh-my-posh init nu --config ~/.jandedobbeleer.omp.json --print | save /mylocation/myscript.nu
source /mylocation/myscript.nu
```

Once altered, restart nu shell for the changes to take effect.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip wsl
When using oh-my-posh in Windows and the WSL, know that you can **share your theme with the WSL** by pointing to a theme in your
Windows user's home folder.

Inside the WSL, you can find your Windows user's home folder here: `/mnt/c/Users/<WINDOWSUSERNAME>`.
:::

:::tip remote config
The `--config` flag can accept either a local filepath or a remotely hosted config file.

For example, the following is a valid `--config` flag:

```
--config 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/jandedobbeleer.omp.json'
```
:::

### Export the current theme

Maybe there's a theme you like, but you don't fancy the colors. Or, maybe there's a segment you
want to tweak/add, or replace some of the icons with a different one. Whatever the case, **read through
available options first**, by starting with the [configuration guide][configuration].

You can export the current theme (default, or set via `--config`) to the format you like (`json`, `yaml`, or `toml`)
which can be used to tweak and store as your own custom theme.


```bash
oh-my-posh config export --output ~/.mytheme.omp.json
```

### JSON Schema Validation

Oh My Posh themes can utilize JSON Schema to validate their contents. Themes should include a link to an [external document][json-schema]
which describes the appropriate structure and contents for various elements. If your code editor is configured to 
use JSON Schema, it will compare your custom theme to the external document, and issue warnings for discrepancies.

For example, given the following code:

```json
...
"segments": [
  {
    "type": "an_invalid_entry",
    "template": "{{ if gt .Code 0 }}\uf134{{ end }}",
  }
]
...
```

Warnings will be raised for type, since `an_invalid_entry` is not in the list of acceptable values, as well as 
for the entire segment entry (enclosed in {}), since it lacks the required `style` key. Take advantage of these 
warnings, and ignore them at your peril.

### Accepted Formats

Oh My Posh supports three file formats for themes: `json`, `yaml`, and `toml`. 

Various converters exist to convert between these, although they aren't perfect and will require manaual
adjustment. Notably, the schema implementation for json is as follows:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/schema.json"
}
```

While for yaml:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/schema.json
```

Converters won't catch this change, so you will need to adjust manually.
