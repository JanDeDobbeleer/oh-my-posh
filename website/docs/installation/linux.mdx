## Set up your terminal

Oh My Posh uses ANSI color codes under the hood, these should work in every terminal,
but you may have to set the environment variable `$TERM` to `xterm-256color` for it to work.

:::info
To display all icons, we recommend the use of a [Nerd Font][fonts].

## Installation

<Tabs
  defaultValue="homebrew"
  groupId="install"
  values={[
    { label: 'Homebrew', value: 'homebrew', },
    { label: 'Manual', value: 'manual', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="homebrew">

<InstallHomebrew />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual">

:::info
Before running the below commands, make sure that you have updated `curl` and the
client certificate store on the target machine.

The installation script requires the following tools to be installed:

- `curl`
- `unzip`
- `realpath`
- `dirname`

:::

Install the latest version for your system by running the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s
```

By default the script will install to `~/bin` or `~/.local/bin` depending on which one exists,
or the existing Oh My Posh executable's installation folder.
If you want to install to a different location you can specify it using the `-d` flag:

```bash
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s -- -d ~/bin
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
