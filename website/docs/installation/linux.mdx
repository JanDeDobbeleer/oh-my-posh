## Set up your terminal

Oh My Posh uses ANSI color codes under the hood, these should work in every terminal,
but you may have to set the environment variable `$TERM` to `xterm-256color` for it to work.

:::info
To display all icons, we recommend the use of a [Nerd Font][fonts].

## Installation

:::info
Before running the below commands, make sure that you have updated `curl` and the
client certificate store on the target machine.

The installation script requires the following tools to be installed:

- `curl`
- `unzip`
- `realpath`
- `dirname`

:::

:::tip Alpine Linux
Oh My Posh fully supports Alpine Linux on both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures, including when running in Docker containers.
The installation script automatically detects musl-based systems and downloads optimized builds.
:::

Install the latest version for your system by running the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s
```

By default the script will install to `~/bin` or `~/.local/bin` depending on which one exists,
or the existing Oh My Posh executable's installation folder.
If you want to install to a different location you can specify it using the `-d` flag:

```bash
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s -- -d ~/bin
```

### Alpine Linux Specific

Alpine Linux uses musl libc instead of glibc. Oh My Posh provides optimized builds for Alpine systems.
The installation script will automatically detect your system type and download the appropriate build.

If you're using Alpine in a Docker container, you can also install Oh My Posh like this:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add --no-cache bash curl unzip realpath

RUN curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s -- -d /usr/local/bin
```

Then configure your shell to use Oh My Posh:

```bash
eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash)"
```
