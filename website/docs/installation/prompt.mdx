:::tip
If you have no idea which shell you're currently using, Oh My Posh has a utility switch that can tell that to you.
:::

```bash
oh-my-posh get shell
```

<Tabs
  defaultValue="powershell"
  groupId="shell"
  values={[
    { label: 'bash', value: 'bash', },
    { label: 'cmd', value: 'cmd', },
    { label: 'elvish', value: 'elvish', },
    { label: 'fish', value: 'fish', },
    { label: 'nu', value: 'nu', },
    { label: 'powershell', value: 'powershell', },
    { label: 'tcsh', value: 'tcsh', },
    { label: 'xonsh', value: 'xonsh', },
    { label: 'zsh', value: 'zsh', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

Add the following to `~/.bashrc` (could be `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile` depending on your environment):

```bash
eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash)"
```

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```bash
exec bash
```

Or, when using `~/.profile`.

```bash
. ~/.profile
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cmd">

There's no out-of-the-box support for Windows CMD when it comes to custom prompts.
There is however a way to do it using [Clink][clink], which at the same time supercharges
your cmd experience. Follow the installation instructions and make sure you select autostart.

Integrating Oh My Posh with Clink is easy: create a new file called oh-my-posh.lua in your Clink
scripts directory (run `clink info` inside cmd to find that file's location).

```lua title="oh-my-posh.lua"
load(io.popen('oh-my-posh init cmd'):read("*a"))()
```

Once added, restart cmd for the changes to take effect.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="elvish">

Add the following at the end of `~/.elvish/rc.elv`:

```bash
eval (oh-my-posh init elvish)
```

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```bash
exec elvish
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="fish">

:::caution
Oh My Posh requires fish v3.4.0 or higher.
:::

Initialize Oh My Posh in `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```bash
oh-my-posh init fish | source
```

Once added, reload your config for the changes to take effect.

```bash
exec fish
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nu">

:::caution
Oh My Posh requires Nushell v0.93.0 or higher.
:::

Add the following line to the Nushell env file (`$nu.env-path`):

```bash
oh-my-posh init nu
```

This saves the initialization script to `~/.oh-my-posh.nu`.
Now, edit the Nushell config file (`$nu.config-path`) and add the following line at the bottom:

```bash
source ~/.oh-my-posh.nu
```

If you want to save the initialization script elsewhere, you can change the first line to something like this:

```bash
oh-my-posh init nu --print | save /mylocation/myscript.nu --force
```

And change the `source` line to:

```bash
source /mylocation/myscript.nu
```

Once added, restart Nushell for the changes to take effect.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

Edit your PowerShell profile script, you can find its location under the `$PROFILE` variable in your preferred PowerShell version. For example, using notepad:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

:::info
When the above command gives an error, make sure to create the profile first.

```powershell
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force
```

In this scenario, it can also be that PowerShell blocks running local scripts. To solve that, set PowerShell
to only require remote scripts to be signed using `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine`, or [sign the profile][sign].
:::

Then add the following line.

```powershell
oh-my-posh init pwsh | Invoke-Expression
```

:::tip Antivirus software
If adding an exception to your Antivirus software still blocks Oh My Posh for Windows, you can try using the below
alternate line in your PowerShell profile. This is a drop-in replacement to the above call with Invoke-Expression.
Tested with PowerShell 7.2.4 with Bitdefender Antivirus installed and requires NO exceptions for oh-my-posh.exe.
Bitdefender blocks the calls to Invoke-Expression as malicious code and this alternate line skips the double calls:

```powershell
& ([ScriptBlock]::Create((oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH\jandedobbeleer.omp.json" --print) -join "`n"))
```
:::

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```powershell
. $PROFILE
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tcsh">

Add the following at the end of `~/.tcshrc`:

```bash
eval `oh-my-posh init tcsh`
```

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```bash
exec tcsh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="xonsh">

Add the following line at the end of `~/.xonshrc`:

```bash
execx($(oh-my-posh init xonsh))
```

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```bash
exec xonsh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="zsh">

Add the following to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(oh-my-posh init zsh)"
```

:::tip
As the standard terminal has issues displaying the ANSI characters correctly, you might want to skip loading just for that terminal and instead of the line above, place this in your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
if [ "$TERM_PROGRAM" != "Apple_Terminal" ]; then
  eval "$(oh-my-posh init zsh)"
fi
```

Note this will still load Oh My Posh for [iTerm2][iterm2] or any other modern day macOS terminal that supports ANSI characters.
:::

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```bash
exec zsh
```
