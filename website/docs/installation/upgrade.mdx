## Manual

While you can always follow the upgrade steps listed under the installation section,
you can also use the `upgrade` command to update Oh My Posh to the latest version.

```powershell
oh-my-posh upgrade
```

## Automatic

In case you want to enable auto-upgrades, you need to edit your configuration file.
If you don't yet have a configuration file, have a look at the [customize page][customize] to get started,
afterwards you can add the following line to your configuration file:

import Config from "@site/src/components/Config.js";

<Config
  data={{
    "auto_upgrade": true
  }}
/>
