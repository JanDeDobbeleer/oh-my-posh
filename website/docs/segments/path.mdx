## Mapped Locations

Allows you to override a location with an icon/string.
It validates if the current path **starts with the specific elements** and replaces it with the icon/string if there's a match.
To avoid issues with nested overrides, Oh My Posh will sort the list of mapped locations before doing a replacement.

| Name                       | Type      | Default | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | :-------: | :-----: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mapped_locations_enabled` | `boolean` | `true`  | replace known locations in the path with the replacements before applying the style      |
| `mapped_locations`         | `object`  |         | custom glyph/text for specific paths. Works regardless of the `mapped_locations_enabled` |

setting.

For example, to swap out `C:\Users\Leet\GitHub` with a GitHub icon, you can do the following:

```json
"mapped_locations": {
  "C:\\Users\\Leet\\GitHub": "\uF09B"
}
```

### Notes

- To make mapped locations work cross-platform, use `/` as the path separator, Oh My Posh will
  automatically match effective separators based on the running operating system.
- If you want to match all child directories, you can use `*` as a wildcard, for example:
  `"C:/Users/Bill/*": "$"` will turn `C:/Users/Bill/Downloads` into `$/Downloads`.
- The character `~` at the start of a mapped location will match the user's home directory.
- The match is case-insensitive on Windows and macOS, but case-sensitive on other operating systems. This means that for
  user Bill, who has a user account `Bill` on Windows and `bill` on Linux, `~/Foo` might match
  `C:\Users\Bill\Foo` or `C:\Users\Bill\foo` on Windows but only `/home/bill/Foo` on Linux.

## Style

Style sets the way the path is displayed. Based on previous experience and popular themes, there are 10 flavors.

- `agnoster`
- `agnoster_full`
- `agnoster_short`
- `agnoster_left`
- `full`
- `folder`
- `mixed`
- `letter`
- `unique`
- `powerlevel`

### Agnoster

Renders each intermediate folder as the `folder_icon` separated by the `folder_separator_icon`.
The first and the last (current) folder name are always displayed as-is.

### Agnoster Full

Renders each folder name separated by the `folder_separator_icon`.

### Agnoster Short

When more than `max_depth` levels deep, it renders one `folder_icon` (if `hide_root_location` is `false`,
which means the root folder does not count for depth) followed by the names of the last `max_depth` folders,
separated by the `folder_separator_icon`.

### Agnoster Left

Renders each folder as the `folder_icon` separated by the `folder_separator_icon`.
Only the first folder name and its child are displayed in full.

### Full

Display the current working directory as a full string with each folder separated by the `folder_separator_icon`.

### Folder

Display the name of the current folder.

### Mixed

Works like `Agnoster`, but for any intermediate folder name that is short enough, it will be displayed as-is.
The maximum length for the folders to display is governed by the `mixed_threshold` property.

### Letter

Works like `Agnoster Full`, but will write every folder name using the first letter only, except when the folder name
starts with a symbol or icon. Specially, the last (current) folder name is always displayed in full.

- `folder` will be shortened to `f`
- `.config` will be shortened to `.c`
- `__pycache__` will be shortened to `__p`
- `➼ folder` will be shortened to `➼ f`

### Unique

Works like `Letter`, but will make sure every folder name is the shortest unique value.

The uniqueness refers to the displayed path, so `C:\dev\dev\dev\development` will be displayed as
`C\d\de\dev\development` (instead of `C\d\d\d\development` for `Letter`). Uniqueness does **not** refer to other
folders at the same level, so if `C:\projectA\dev` and `C:\projectB\dev` exist, then both will be displayed as
`C\p\dev`.

### Powerlevel

Works like `Unique`, but will stop shortening when `max_width` is reached.
